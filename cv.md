## About me:
Hi there, I’m Denis and I’m from Penza, it’s 650km from Moscow. Pavel Volya from Penza you know.

I love frontend technologies and _I want to improve my JavaScript and HTML/CSS skills_.

My goal is **to work in a big company with a good team**.

**My priority** is the customer must be happy with the product.

## Praise myself a little bit:
-	I like **to study on my own** and I do it all the time;
-	I’m assiduous;
-	I like sports a lot, weightlifting, riding a bike, jogging;
-	I can work hard if it's needed;

I’ve been working web since 2003. I started by creating simple business card websites. I created sites on the most popular CMS such as WordPress, Joomla, MODx, etc.

Now I’m working in a manufacturing company as a Web-developer. I'm creating an enterprise website for them. And I want to improve my developer skills.
